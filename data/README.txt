We used i2b2 2010 Challenge dataset for entity extraction tasks. 

Note: We have not included the dataset here due to certain terms and conditions associated with the data. But, you can follow the steps below and prepare the data for training and testing the model.

a). Download the dataset and place 'test' and 'train' data into the appropriate directories.
b). You only need concepts(.con) and text(.txt) files from the data for entity extraction purpose.
c). Sample files are provided in the "test_data" and "train_data" directories.
d). 'data_analysis.py' provides preliminary insight into the data.
